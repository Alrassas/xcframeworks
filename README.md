## Pre-requisities
- Xcode 11
- Swift 5.1 toolchain - run `sudo xcode-select -s path/to/Xcode11` in terminal.
- Github/Gitlab/Bitbucket account set in Xcode's account preferences

# Introduction: New .xcframework format

## Requirements
- Xcode11
- Swift 5.1 and above

## Motivation & consequences
- introduce standard format to gain module stability for your Swift frameworks & libraries. Library author & client of a library are no longer required to use the same version of compiler
- provide seamless experience when creating & integrating the module stable frameworks
- support all Apple platforms and architectures
NOTE: while `fat framework` can support module stability, the `lipo` command line tool, that is used to fuse the frameworks together, is not officially supported by Apple. Also using `lipo` tools falls short in cases of fusing two platforms with similar architectures together - e.g. arm6 architecture can be found in iOS + watchOS.

- **STOP** creating & using `fat frameworks` == no more `lipo`.
- **STOP** slicing frameworks by stripping the architectures in your projects' targets' custom `build-phase`.

## Contents of xcframework

This format bundles module-stable frameworks (.swiftinterface) for the platforms of interest.

The [Info.plist](./Products/xcframeworks/DynamicFramework.xcframework) contains all available frameworks in a bundle. This information is used by Xcode during the linking time => xcodebuild picks the right framework for the platform we're building against

The structure of xcframework looks as shown below
![xcframework](./res/xcframework.png)

## Size of xcframework
The size of an `xcframework` was smaller than the size of an corresponding `fat framework`. I tested swift only & mixed frameworks.
Generally the `lipo` commandline tool adds a bit of overhead for all contained architectures.

## Platforms
xcframework supports all Apple platforms - `iOS`, `macOS`, `tvOS`, `watchOS`, `iPadOS`, `carPlayOS`.

## List of destinations
| Platform  |  Destination |
|---|---|
| iOS  | generic/platform=iOS  |
| iOS Simulator  | generic/platform=iOS Simulator |
| iPadOS  | generic/platform=iPadOS |
| iPadOS Simulator  | generic/platform=iPadOS Simulator|
| macOS  | generic/platform=macOS  |
| tvOS  | generic/platform=tvOS  |
| watchOS | generic/platform=watchOS |
| watchOS Simulator | generic/platform=watchOS Simulator |
| carPlayOS | generic/platform=carPlayOS
| carPlayOS Simulator | generic/platform=carPlayOS Simulator

# How to create .xcframework that contain iOS + iOS Simulator platforms

## 1. Archive your scheme for desired platforms (destinations)
1.1 Pass `SKIP_INSTALL=NO` && `BUILD_LIBRARY_FOR_DISTRIBUTION=YES` to archive your scheme

```swift
xcodebuild archive \
-workspace MyWorkspace.xcworkspace \
-scheme MyScheme \
-destination destination="generic/platform=iOS" \
-archivePath "archives/MyScheme-iOS" \
SKIP_INSTALL=NO \
BUILD_LIBRARY_FOR_DISTRIBUTION=YES
```

1.2 **iOS Simulator** - archive your scheme for iOS Simulator platform by specifying correct destination `destination="generic/platform=iOS Simulator"` & point archivePath to architecture specific path, e.g. `archives/MyScheme-iOS-Simulator`.

```swift
xcodebuild archive \
..
-destination destination="generic/platform=iOS Simulator" \
-archivePath "archives/MyScheme-iOS-Simulator" \
..
```

1.3 **iOS** - archive your scheme for iOS by specifying `destination="generic/platform=iOS"` & point archivePath to device specific path. The architecture specific path will ensure the archive from step 2. wont be overwritten, e.g. `MyScheme-iOS`

```
xcodebuild archive \
..
-destination destination="generic/platform=iOS" \
-archivePath "archives/MyScheme-iOS" \
..
```

### Locations
Binaries in `.xcarchive` are located under:

* `Products/Library/Frameworks` folder for dynamic frameworks
* `Products/usr/local/lib` folder for static libraries

## 2. Create .xcframework from built archives

`xcodebuild` allows you to create xcframework by specifying frameworks, libraries or even can add headers to the libraries.
![-create-xcframework](./res/xcodebuild_create_xc_framework.png)


###### 1. Specify all frameworks or libraries that you want to add into .xcframework

###### 2. Specify the outpath paht using `-output` argument. Don't forget to add `.xcframework` extension to your output path.

```
xcodebuild -create-xcframework \
           -framework My-iOS.framework \
           -framework My-iOS_Simulator.framework \
           -output My.xcframework
```

Module stability is gained with Xcode 11 + Swift 5.1, once your module declares `.swiftinterface` file, that describes the public interface of your framework along with linker flags, used toolchain and other info. Swift interface can be found under your framework's `swiftmodule` folder.
`.swiftinterface` file is autogenerated when xcframework is created.

![swift-interface](./res/swiftinterface.png)

## Generate .xcframeworks for iOS + iOS Simulator using create_xcframeworks.sh script
The archiving and creation of `.xcframework` is excercised by [create_xcframeworks.sh](/scripts/create_xcframeworks.sh) script.

This script takes 1 parameter that defines output directory.
`Output directory` will create subfolder for `archives` and `xcframeworks`.

The script will:
- archive the scheme `StaticLibrary` & create the .xcframework
- archive the scheme `DynamicFramework` & create the .xcframework

![Generated xcframework](./res/generated_xcframework.png)

`Usage`

```
./scripts/create_xcframeworks.sh OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_NAME
```

eg.
```
./scripts/create_xcframeworks.sh Products
```

# Testing & Troubleshooting

Make sure to always build & run your generated xcframework before distributing it to your clients.
Few of the **problems will unveil just at the compile or run time**, so **don't** rely solely on the success of the xcframework creation.

Here's the list of compiler errors I got across when integrating built xcframework into Xcode project.

| Problem  | Severity |  Description | Solution |
|---|---|---|---|
| Redundant conformance of `x` to `NSObjectProtocol` | error - thrown at dynamic linking time | Your class is already subclassed from `NSObject`, which conforms to `NSObjectProtocol`  | Check protocol conformances of your classes and remove redundant conformance to `NSObjectProtocol` |
| Use of unimplemented initializer 'init()' for class | error - thrown at dynamic linking time | Objective-C ABI public classes need to provide `public` init | Provide `public` init override for your public class:  `override public init()` |
| @objc' class method in extension of subclass of `Class X` requires iOS 13.0.0 | error | Rules for interoperability with Objective-C has changed since iOS 13.0.0. and currently doesn't support `@objc` interoperability in class extensions. There's open question on [Swift forums](https://forums.swift.org/t/xcframework-requires-to-target-ios-13-for-inter-framework-dependencies-with-objective-c-compatibility-tested-with-xcode-11-beta-7/28539) | Move/Remove `@objc` declaration from your Swift class extension |
| scoped imports are not yet supported in module interfaces | warning | Read more about Swift import declarations here: https://nshipster.com/import/ | Import the module instead of specific declaration. For example: change `import class MyModule.MyClass` to `import MyModule` |

# Distribution of xcframeworks
* **manually** - already available

* **CocoaPods**
    - supported since v1.9.1
    - use `vendored_frameworks` to specify you xcframework(s) in your podspec. e.g. `s.vendored_frameworks = 'DynamicFramework.xcframework'`


* **Carthage**  

    - Carthage doesn't support xcframework format yet.
    - [Roadmap to provide support for xcframeworks 2019/2020](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/issues/2890)


* **Swift Package Manager**

    - [Proposal (SE-0272 Package Manager Binary Dependencies) was already implemented, but is not part of Swift 5.2 release](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0272-package-manager-binary-dependencies/30753)
    - Swift Package Manager currently doesnt support binary dependencies
    - Based on [this](https://forums.swift.org/t/accepted-with-modifications-se-0272-package-manager-binary-dependencies/31926/9) response from Apple engineer, the support for binary dependencies will be introduced in the next major release of Swift, probably `Swift 6.0` & hopefully also in next version of Xcode -> `Xcode 12.0` (my personal guess ðŸ¤ž)

# How to integrate .xcframework in your project

1. Drag & drop .xcframework manually into your project's target
